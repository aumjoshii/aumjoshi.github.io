## About Me

Hi, I'm Aum Joshi! I’m a tech enthusiast who loves to code, travel, make music, and laugh at memes. Here’s a quick snapshot of who I am:

- **Coder by Day:** I’m passionate about diving into new programming languages and solving complex problems. My tech stack includes Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, NoSQL, and more. I thrive on creating innovative solutions and continuously improving my skills.
- **Musician by Night:** Music is my creative escape. I play the piano and guitar, and I enjoy producing my own music. Whether I’m composing a new piece or experimenting with different sounds, music brings a sense of balance and joy to my life.
- **Traveler at Heart:** Exploring new places and immersing myself in different cultures is something I deeply enjoy. Traveling not only fuels my creativity but also provides me with fresh perspectives and inspiration for my work.
- **Meme Lover:** When I need a break from coding or traveling, you’ll find me scrolling through memes. It’s my guilty pleasure and a great way to unwind and stay connected with internet culture.
